            <p>A text editor is at the core of a developer’s toolbox, but it doesn't usually work alone. Work with Git and GitHub directly from Atom with the GitHub package.</p>

            <div class="welcome-bgs">
                <img src="/assets/images/index-github-screenshot.png" class="welcome-bg welcome-bg--screenshot" />
            </div>

            <p>Create new branches, stage and commit, push and pull, resolve merge conflicts, view pull requests and more—all from within your editor. The GitHub package is already bundled with Atom, so you're ready to go!</p>
